## üêõ Known Issues

### Critical Issues
- **None currently identified**

### High Priority Issues
- **None currently identified**

### Medium Priority Issues

#### Audio Playback
- **Limited Pitch Shifting**: Current pitch adjustment uses playback rate, which affects tempo
- **Audio Quality**: Some audio formats may not play correctly
- **Latency**: Audio playback may have noticeable latency

#### Sample Management
- **Large File Handling**: Very large sample files may cause performance issues
- **Memory Usage**: Loading many samples can consume significant memory
- **File Path Handling**: Long file paths may cause issues on some systems

#### User Interface
- **Accessibility**: Limited accessibility features for users with disabilities
- **High DPI**: UI may not scale properly on high DPI displays
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Limited keyboard navigation support

### Low Priority Issues

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Windows-specific**: Some features may not work on macOS/Linux
- **Path Separators**: File path handling may need improvement for cross-platform use
- **Audio Drivers**: Different audio drivers may behave differently

#### Performance
- **Startup Time**: Application startup time could be optimized
- **Memory Leaks**: Potential memory leaks in long-running sessions
- **CPU Usage**: High CPU usage during certain operations
